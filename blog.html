    It is not hard to start it as I have some experience on using Github on other computer science courses before. <br/>
    The problem is I use windows instead of mac now,so I have to download Github desktop that is a little bit<br />
    complex then terminal on mac (framework 3.0 is noticed to install),But finally,everything works well <br />
